Weather is the main determinate factor which would enable me make money year round therefore, this analysis is to help protray to investors that the chosen location is the best place to have surf and shake shop. 



Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed. Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December. Based on the below data for the months June and December as compared to the overall precipitations collected from one station, it can be conclude that the average temperature for the year is above 74 degrees which is about 75% most to the time in Hawaii.The maximum temperature of 85 degrees is definately good for the business in the month of June and relatively the same in December which would have approximately 2 degrees change. Investors would be able to deduct from the data and know that weather is not going to be a factor in the surf and shake business.

Deliverable 3 Requirements

For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

1. Among the 9 stations selected, it revealed same weather statistics with a minimum temperature of 64 in the month of June. June is the time most families go on vacations  and december is also not bad with a maximum of 85 degrees when other states have very low cold temperature. Comparatively tourist would still choose Hawaii to visit during that time and business would be able to sustain all year round.
2. Eventhough precipation for station USC00519281 it had a great temperature of 85 degrees. The only consideration for the differences in temperature wihich will cause the buseiness to adjust is that in December the temperature reduces by an average of 5 to 9 degrees making it a little cooler in the mornings but could rise up to a maximum of 83 degrees with 2 degrees difference compared to June's maximum temperature. 
3. From the data recieved there might be no much difference in the overall temperature since the count for June is more than December temperature and that could affect the temperature data result. Looking over the standard of deviation in the december and June temperature, there are no much difference in the change of the overall temperature with less that .5 points in the deviation result. It can be concluded that the weather in Hawaii would be a good place for Surf and Shake business year round. 

The data collected can be amended to select the station that the business would be located therefore a query can be used to deduct the information which could be benefical in business negotiation since the investor had entered into such a business and it did fail

Finally with global warming the years to compare the data could be limited to 5 years instead of over 10 years to be able eliminate excess data which affect the overall outcome of the statistical analysis
